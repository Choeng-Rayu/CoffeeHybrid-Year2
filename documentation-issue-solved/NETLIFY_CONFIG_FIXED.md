# ✅ **Netlify Configuration Fixed!**

## ❌ **The Error:**
```
Could not parse configuration file
Can't redefine existing key at row 11, col 19, pos 217:
[build.environment]
```

## ✅ **The Fix:**
The `netlify.toml` file had duplicate `[build.environment]` sections. I've fixed it!

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Before (Broken):**
```toml
[build]
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "18" }  # ❌ First definition

[build.environment]  # ❌ Second definition - CONFLICT!
  VITE_API_URL = "..."
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]  # ✅ Single, clean definition
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  VITE_API_URL = "https://coffeehybrid.onrender.com/api"
  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "187399692537-khqvmab549j79vm50janl6jjpfscgc9l.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  VITE_NODE_ENV = "production"
