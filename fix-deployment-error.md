# 🔧 Digital Ocean Deployment Error Fix

## ❌ Error Encountered
```
addgroup: group 'nginx' in use
error building image: error building stage: failed to execute command: waiting for process to exit: exit status 1
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The nginx:alpine Docker image already includes a `nginx` group and user. Our Dockerfile was trying to create a new nginx group, which caused a conflict.

## ✅ Solution Applied
Updated `Frontend/Dockerfile` to:
1. Use the existing nginx user instead of creating a new one
2. Install wget before switching to nginx user (for health checks)
3. Properly set ownership of nginx directories

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Commit and push the fix:
```bash
git add Frontend/Dockerfile
git commit -m "Fix nginx user conflict in Frontend Dockerfile"
git push origin main
```

2. Redeploy in Digital Ocean:
   - Go to your Digital Ocean App Platform dashboard
   - Click on your app
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Create Deployment" to trigger a new build

## 📋 Fixed Dockerfile Changes
- Removed duplicate nginx group creation
- Used existing nginx user from nginx:alpine image
- Installed wget as root before switching to nginx user
- Properly set file ownership for nginx directories

The deployment should now succeed without the nginx group conflict error.
